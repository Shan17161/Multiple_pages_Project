    <main>
        <p>Volleyball is a team sport in which two teams of six players are separated by a net. Each team tries to score points by grounding a ball on the other team's court under organized rules.[1] It has been a part of the official program of the Summer Olympic Games since Tokyo 1964. Beach volleyball was introduced to the programme at the Atlanta 1996 Summer Olympics. The adapted version of volleyball at the Summer Paralympic Games is sitting volleyball.

            The complete set of rules is extensive,[2] but play essentially proceeds as follows: a player on one of the teams begins a 'rally' by serving the ball (tossing or releasing it and then hitting it with a hand or arm), from behind the back boundary line of the court, over the net, and into the receiving team's court.[3] The receiving team must not let the ball be grounded within their court. The team may touch the ball up to three times to return the ball to the other side of the court, but individual players may not touch the ball twice consecutively.[3] Typically, the first two touches are used to set up for an attack. An attack is an attempt to direct the ball back over the net in such a way that the team receiving the ball is unable to pass the ball and continue the rally, thus, losing the point. The team that wins the rally is awarded a point and serves the ball to start the next rally. A few of the most common faults include:</p>

        <p>In December 1895,[6] in Holyoke, Massachusetts (United States), William G. Morgan, a YMCA physical education director, created a new game called Mintonette, a name derived from the game of badminton,[7] as a pastime to preferably be played indoors and by any number of players. The game took some of its characteristics from other sports such as baseball, tennis, and handball.[8] Another indoor sport, basketball, was catching on in the area, having been invented just ten miles (sixteen kilometres) away in the city of Springfield, Massachusetts, only four years before. Mintonette was designed to be an indoor sport, less rough than basketball, for older members of the YMCA, while still requiring a bit of athletic effort.

            The first rules, written down by Morgan, called for a net 6 ft 6 in (1.98 m) high, a 25 ft × 50 ft (7.6 m × 15.2 m) court, and any number of players. A match was composed of nine innings with three serves for each team in each inning, and no limit to the number of ball contacts for each team before sending the ball to the opponents' court. In case of a serving error, a second try was allowed. Hitting the ball into the net was considered a foul (with loss of the point or a side-out)—except in the case of the first-try serve.
            
            After an observer, Alfred Halstead, noticed the volleying nature of the game at its first exhibition match in 1896, played at the International YMCA Training School (now called Springfield College), the game quickly became known as volleyball (it was originally spelled as two words: "volley ball"). Volleyball rules were slightly modified by the International YMCA Training School and the game spread around the country to various YMCAs.[9][10]
            
            In the early 1900s Spalding, through its publishing company American Sports Publishing Company, produced books with complete instruction and rules for the sport.[11]
            The first official ball used in volleyball is disputed; some sources say Spalding created the first official ball in 1896, while others claim it was created in 1900.[12][13][14] The rules evolved over time: in 1916, in the Philippines, the skill and power of the set and spike had been introduced, and four years later a "three hits" rule and a rule against hitting from the back row were established. In 1917, the game was changed from requiring 21 points to win to a smaller 15 points to win. In 1919, about 16,000 volleyballs were distributed by the American Expeditionary Forces to their troops and allies, which sparked the growth of volleyball in new countries.[12]

            The first country outside the United States to adopt volleyball was Canada in 1900.[12] An international federation, the Fédération Internationale de Volleyball (FIVB), was founded in 1947, and the first World Championships were held in 1949 for men and 1952 for women.[15] The sport is now popular in Brazil, in Europe, where especially Italy, the Netherlands, and Eastern Europe have been major forces since the late 1980s, in Russia, in other countries, including China and the rest of Asia, and in the United States.[9][10][15]
            
            Beach volleyball, a variation of the game played on sand and with only two players per team, became a FIVB-endorsed variation in 1987 and was added to the Olympic program at the 1996 Summer Olympics.[12][15] Volleyball is also a sport at the Paralympics managed by the World Organization Volleyball for Disabled.
            
            Nudists were early adopters of the game with regular organized play in clubs as early as the late 1920s.[16][17] By the 1960s, a volleyball court had become standard in almost all nudist/naturist clubs.[18]
            
            A recent issue within the sport is the inclusion of transgender players. With transgender athletes such as Tiffany Abreu joining professional volleyball teams alongside other non-transgender teammates, many professionals, sports analysts, and fans of volleyball are either expressing concerns about the legitimacy and fairness of having transgender players on a team or expressing support for the transgender people's efforts.[</p>

        <h2>Growth of amateur and professional cricket in England</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Evolution of the cricket bat. The original "hockey stick" (left)
            evolved into the straight bat from c. 1760 when pitched delivery
            bowling began.
            Although the main object of the game has always been to score
            the most runs, the early form of cricket differed from the
            modern game in certain key technical aspects; the North American
            variant of cricket known as wicket retained many of these
            aspects.[14] The ball was bowled underarm by the bowler and
            along the ground towards a batter armed with a bat that in shape
            resembled a hockey stick; the batter defended a low, two-stump
            wicket; and runs were called notches because the scorers
            recorded them by notching tally sticks.[15][16][17]

            In 1611, the year Cotgrave's dictionary was published,
            ecclesiastical court records at Sidlesham in Sussex state that
            two parishioners, Bartholomew Wyatt and Richard Latter, failed
            to attend church on Easter Sunday because they were playing
            cricket. They were fined 12d each and ordered to do penance.[18]
            This is the earliest mention of adult participation in cricket
            and it was around the same time that the earliest known
            organised inter-parish or village match was played – at
            Chevening, Kent.[6][19] In 1624, a player called Jasper Vinall
            died after he was accidentally struck on the head during a match
            between two parish teams in Sussex.[20]

            Cricket remained a low-key local pursuit for much of the 17th
            century.[10] It is known, through numerous references found in
            the records of ecclesiastical court cases, to have been
            proscribed at times by the Puritans before and during the
            Commonwealth.[21][22] The problem was nearly always the issue of
            Sunday play as the Puritans considered cricket to be "profane"
            if played on the Sabbath, especially if large crowds or gambling
            were involved.[23][24]

            According to the social historian Derek Birley, there was a
            "great upsurge of sport after the Restoration" in 1660.[25]
            Several members of the court of King Charles II took a strong
            interest in cricket during that era.[26] Gambling on sport
            became a problem significant enough for Parliament to pass the
            1664 Gambling Act, limiting stakes to £100 which was, in any
            case, a colossal sum exceeding the annual income of 99% of the
            population.[25] Along with horse racing, as well as
            prizefighting and other types of blood sport, cricket was
            perceived to be a gambling sport.[27] Rich patrons made matches
            for high stakes, forming teams in which they engaged the first
            professional players.[28] By the end of the century, cricket had
            developed into a major sport that was spreading throughout
            England and was already being taken abroad by English mariners
            and colonisers – the earliest reference to cricket overseas is
            dated 1676.[29] A 1697 newspaper report survives of
            "a great cricket match" played in Sussex
            "for fifty guineas apiece" – this is the earliest known contest
            that is generally considered a First Class match.[30][31]
        The first official ball used in volleyball is disputed; some sources say Spalding created the first official ball in 1896, while others claim it was created in 1900.[12][13][14] The rules evolved over time: in 1916, in the Philippines, the skill and power of the set and spike had been introduced, and four years later a "three hits" rule and a rule against hitting from the back row were established. In 1917, the game was changed from requiring 21 points to win to a smaller 15 points to win. In 1919, about 16,000 volleyballs were distributed by the American Expeditionary Forces to their troops and allies, which sparked the growth of volleyball in new countries.[12]

Beach volleyball, a variation of the game played on sand and with only two players per team, became a FIVB-endorsed variation in 1987 and was added to the Olympic program at the 1996 Summer Olympics.[12][15] Volleyball is also a sport at the Paralympics managed by the World Organization Volleyball for Disabled.

Nudists were early adopters of the game with regular organized play in clubs as early as the late 1920s.[16][17] By the 1960s, a volleyball court had become standard in almost all nudist/naturist clubs.[18]
